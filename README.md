# TITANIC-PREDICTION-KAGGLE-

This is my first R project

I participated in this Kaggle competition. We were required to predict whether passengers aboard the titanic survived or died

I used R language and Jupyter notebook to accomplish this

I worked with Logistic Regression and Random Forest as my models but ended up choosing Random Forest as it performed better

Ended up getting a prediction accuracy score of 76% after submitting my output to kaggle
